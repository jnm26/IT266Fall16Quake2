# Quake-2-Stealth-Mod
Inspired by the stealth action of Dishonored, this Q2 stealth mod will have you blinking (teleporting) past enemies, laying grenade traps, and pushing and pulling your foes

Experience a new way to play Q2! In this Dishonored inspired mod, I've blended the stealth action of Dishonored with the fast, fluid movement of Quake 2.

Shortlist of changes:

What's going on with the lighting? Quake 2 was staticly lit using basic intensity values. Excellently, the developers determine how visible you are to enemies based on how lit you are. Muzzle flashes will brighten you, as will other scattered light sources throughout the levels. However, the main game lighting is on the fritz. For a few seconds, the light will be on, until it suddenly flickers off. After a few moments, it flickers back. Take advantage of the failing lights to slip past your enemies, and use the darkness to escape if you've been caught. Once the enemies lose Line of Sight, use the darkness to hide. The enemies have a much tougher time chasing the player through the level due to the reduced number of trace points an enemy can use to track you down.

Regular grenades do very little damage, but what's going on with the grenade launcher? The grenade launcher now places sticky grenades throughout the map with a timer of around 10 seconds. Lob a grenade to attract an enemy to its position, and time it with the sticky grenades explosion! Explosion sizes have been increased to make these interactions more forgiving.

The fabled BFG, once a weapon of mass destruction in the Quake world, has become a lowly.... teleporter device? Aim the BFG and click to teleport a short distance ahead. Use this to sneak past your enemies! Make sure you don't run low on Mana, though...

Mana system. There's no more bullets, the player's actions are fully dictated by the use of Mana. Mana recharges slowly, but you'll want to make efficient use of the various mana packs throughout the map to top off your mana and optimize your routes throughout the level.

Push and pull enemies using mana, sending them launching into the sky or pull them close and switch to the blaster for a one shot critical attack

Drain the life of your enemies to fuel your own, but don't waste too much Mana!

Have fun!
